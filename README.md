# delving_into_the_jet_stream
Results from [Ferguson et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11755)
The file `data/delve_jet_photometry_fit_results.csv` contains the mode and 1-sigma errors for the following parameters as a function of `phi_1`
- `phi_2`: track of stream in deg
- `width`: stream width in deg
- `peak_int`: peak intensity/surface brightness of stream in stars/deg^2
- `linear_density`: linear density of stream obtained by `sqrt(2*pi) * peak_int * width`
